 [HarvardX Data Science Series](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.9x+2T2018/course/).

This is one-time work and I did not yet decided if I will be continuing this work.
So I do not expect PRs, but critics and notes are welcomed by means of Issues option.
My work environment is based on Debian derived Linux system, so I may have a trouble supporting problems related to other operating systems.
